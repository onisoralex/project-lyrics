- DONE add possibility to extract text even if notes are missing
- DONE add possibility to display text where notes are missing

--> relevant for texts that have chords only on the first verse
!!! store the chord numbers as numbers based on the key. E.g. chord 5 in the key of C = chord E, chord 5 in the key of G# = C
--> as a result I can easily change the key, without having to generate all the chords and save them again. Thus editing of key directly in database becomes possible without breaking the song.
